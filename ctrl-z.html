        <p>Eldan and I recently went to the Olympic Peninsula to visit my
      parents. It’s a beautiful place, and since my parents recently moved
      there, there’s a lot there that’s new to all of us. One day of that trip
       in particular stands out to me in particular as having been all about
      the anthropocene.</p>
      <p>We started that day by going to the Olympic Game Farm, which is both
      hilarious and terrible. When you arrive, you are cautioned to remain in
      your car, although you’re allowed to roll the windows down, in order to
      feed the animals slices of bread. We all felt weird about feeding the
      animals, so we didn’t buy any.</p>
      <p>In retrospect, I’m pretty sure that ours was only car in the park
      with no bread in it. The animals are tame and they know you’re there to
      see and interact with them, and the bread is definitely what they get
      out of the arrangement.</p>

      <p>It had been a long time since I had seen something as funny as my
      dad’s reaction to a yak ambling over to the truck and sticking its whole
       head in his rolled-down driver’s-side window. The yak’s demeanor was
      somewhere between that of a parking attendant and a friendly dog. During
       our visit, we got sniffed at and snorted on with snuffly broad wet
      noses and drooled upon and unblinkingly stared at and followed by a
      variety of ungulates. We saw a fat old toothless brown bear that would
      wave at you Maneki Neko style for a slice of bread, and a few other ones
       that were younger and and slimmer. They weren’t the sad part.</p>
      <p>The other predators were the sad part, especially the ones that were
      native to the Olympic Peninsula. Why keep two black bears in cages when
      there are many more black bears outside the cages, too? Or a herd of
      elk, really? They were there because they had been born in captivity and
       would have no idea how to comport themselves in the wild. The animals
      there can’t be released, so there they are, for tourists to gawp at and
      throw slices of bread at. The only reason they are in this world at all
      is because humans decided that it would be so.</p>
      <p>The Olympic Game Farm is full of white elephants.</p>
      <p>Later that day, we went up to a dried lake bed that had once been
      Lake Aldwell, which was created by damming the Elwha River. Some lumber
      baron or another had decided to dam the lake in order to produce
      hydroelectric power, and logged the land that was going to be flooded.
      So there was a lake and a dam for a hundred years there, and people went
       boating and fishing.</p>
      <p>A couple of years ago, we collectively decided that it was better to
      un-dam the Elwha. The dams on it were generating only a fraction of a
      percent of the state’s power, the affected course of the Elwha had
      caused flooding elsewhere, and the ecosystem in the Olympic National
      Park was adversely affected by the dams. Anyway, dams aren’t natural, so
       why would we have them in a National Park? So we blew up all the dams.</p>
      <p>It was a start, but it was more of an eraser than an undo button. The
       river flowing through the former lakebed was a pale gray, because it
      carried a hundred years of backed-up sediment. When my parents had gone
      to the same spot a month earlier, they had seen sockeye running there
      already, and that was because some of the salmon had been landlocked for
       generations, and then washed out to sea with a bunch of lake water and
      exploding dam bits.</p>
      <p>What would it have been like for them to arrive in salt water?</p>
      <p>On the banks of the Elwha, the stumps of huge trees that were cut
      down a hundred years ago are exposed now. Eldan and I stood on top of
      one of them, and it was easily seven feet in diameter, as big around as
      the trees in the Grove of the Patriarchs. What had its lumber been used
      for?</p>
      <p><img src="img/eldan-stump.jpg" alt="Eldan on that big stump."></p>
      <p class="image-caption">Eldan on that big stump.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the trip we had gone to the Jamestown S’Klallam carving
      shed and wondered at the size of logs that were waiting to be carved
      into totem poles- huge logs, 700 or 800 years old, the woodcarver had
      said, but they were only half as big around as this stump.</p>
      <p>We can free the Elwha and its salmon, but we can’t know what it would
       have looked like if we had never dammed it. And we’ll never have that
      tree back, and in a hundred years, there may well be tame elk and black
      bears at the Olympic Game Farm, or a population of feral yaks on the
      Olympic Peninsula.</p>
